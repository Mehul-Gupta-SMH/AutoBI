## Project: Automated Report Generation Platform

**To Do List:**

**1. Data Acquisition and Processing:**

* Define the format(s)  supported for report data input (e.g., CSV, Excel).
    * Iteration 1 - CSV (VC to create sample data by 25/04)
    * Iteration 2 - SQL DB (VC to create DB on his local by 30/04)
* Develop logic to parse and clean user uploaded report data.
    * Read csv through python or create DB connection in python
    * Generate EDA report - for data validation only
    * Data Cleaning
        * Handle Missing values - delete for now. Can add options for different imputation techniques at later stage.
        * Data format conversion
        * Remove duplicates
        * Check for inconsistencies and errors in data.
* Explore LLM integration for data pre-processing (e.g., anomaly detection, data enrichment).
            - Not required at the moment. Can work with above methods.

**2. Template Management:**

* Design pre-defined HTML templates for various reporting needs (e.g., financial reports, marketing reports).
    * Start with 3 templates
    * Focus on marketing campaign analytics reports
    * VC to identify/create 3 diiferent templates for marketing reorting
* Implement a system to store and manage these templates.
    * Store templates in a folder in the directory
    * Define template structure (identify common and reusable elements)
    * Template Managments System 
    * Template Compilation- Optional (Merging static content with reports)
    * Loading templates (Load template from location, caching templates, handling error for corrupted templates)

* Develop logic for LLM to suggest the most suitable template based on user data. 

**3. Report Generation:**

*  Design the core functionality to populate templates with user data.
    * Template Rendering: Integrate the loaded templates into your application's rendering process. This typically involves substituting dynamic data into placeholders within the templates.
    * TBD
*  Develop logic for LLM to dynamically generate report content (e.g., charts, narrative summaries).
*  Implement a system for generating complete HTML reports with relevant pages.

**4. User Interface:**

*  Design a user-friendly interface for uploading data and selecting templates.
*  Develop functionalities for users to preview and potentially customize generated reports.
*  Implement functionalities for downloading or sharing the final HTML report.

**5. Testing and Deployment:**

*  Develop a comprehensive testing plan to ensure platform functionality and accuracy.
*  Choose a deployment platform (e.g., web application, cloud service).
*  Implement mechanisms for error handling and user feedback.

**Additional Considerations:**

*  Documenting code and functionalities.
*  Security measures for user data handling.
*  Scalability for handling various data formats and report complexities.

**Bonus:**

*  Explore implementing version control for user reports.
*  Develop functionalities for scheduled report generation.
